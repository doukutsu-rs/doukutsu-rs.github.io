After being around since 2020, we're finally excited to announce our proper home in the web - [doukutsu.rs](https://doukutsu.rs)!

So, we have a blog now! We plan using it mostly for new updates, but we will see what future brings...

We've significantly polished the website's download section. The old website was quite basic, and many users have previously faced difficulties finding latest doukutsu-rs downloads on GitHub. To address this, we built a dedicated page for downloads, which are now organized into **stable**, **experimental**, and **nightly** builds, making things much clearer.

To further help users, especially newcomers, we created user-friendly setup guides in our [Documentation](https://doukutsu-rs.gitbook.io/docs) section - they're now linked directly from the download page - we hope this makes it easier for everyone to get started.

Techy people might be interested in the tech stack used to build this website. It started as quick skeleton generated by Vercel's AI web coding v0 tool, 
which I found a good starting point, especially after further refactoring and (heavy) polishing - as it tends to generate quite bad and repetitive code.

This decision has essentially dictated the technology stack of this whole website - Next.js, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, and MDX.

If you're new to Cave Story, or haven't experienced it with doukutsu-rs before, we especially encourage you to visit the [Downloads](/downloads) section. 
There, you can see firsthand how doukutsu-rs brings this 2004 indie gem into the modern age. With features like smooth motion, dynamic resolutions, 
and enhanced lighting, it's been called by many players as the definitive way to experience Cave Story.

For our existing community - thank you for your continued support! We're excited to have you here for over 4 years now, and we're looking forward to many more.
